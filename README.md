## Getting started

Artifakt PaaS provides specialized [base docker images](https://github.com/artifakt-io/artifakt-docker-images) to build your application images.

These base images are not usable alone, as they include no code or app.

That's why Artifakt provides sample apps like this one to showcase how to build, test and deploy using our special features.

## Pre-requisites

To enjoy the best experience, a recent version of Docker (>=20.10) is required.
Older versions like 19.03 can work by enabling experimental features.
